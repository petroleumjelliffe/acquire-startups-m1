# Multiplayer Architecture Plan

## Overview
Transform the single-client game into a multiplayer experience with:
- Hidden hands (only current player sees their tiles)
- Server-authoritative game state
- Waiting room for player connections
- Public player summary panel

## Architecture Components

### 1. Technology Stack

**Server:**
- Node.js/Express backend
- Socket.io for real-time WebSocket communication
- File-based persistent storage (JSON files) for game state
- UUID generation for game instances and player IDs

**Client:**
- Existing React/TypeScript frontend
- Socket.io-client for server communication
- LocalStorage for persistent client ID
- Separate views for active player vs. spectators

### 1.5 Persistent State & Asynchronous Play

**Game Instance Management:**
- Each game gets a unique hash/ID (e.g., `game-a3f9c2d8`)
- Game state saved to disk after every action
- Games can be resumed at any time using the game ID
- State includes: board, players, turn index, stage, bag, etc.

**Player Identity:**
- Each client generates/retrieves a persistent UUID on first load
- Stored in localStorage: `playerId`
- Used to authenticate player actions
- Allows reconnection to in-progress games

**Asynchronous Play Support:**
- Game state tracks which player's turn it is
- Server validates that actions come from the correct player ID
- Other players shown "Waiting for [PlayerName]..." indicator
- Players can disconnect and reconnect without losing state
- Game persists indefinitely until completed
- No timeouts - players can take turns hours/days apart

**Connection State Tracking:**
- Each player has `isConnected` boolean in game state
- Online/offline indicators shown to all players
- Current player must be connected to take action
- Other players can view game state even if current player offline

### 2. Server Structure

```
server/
├── index.ts              # Express + Socket.io setup
├── gameManager.ts        # Manages multiple game rooms
├── gameState.ts          # Server-side game state logic (from gameLogic.ts)
├── roomManager.ts        # Waiting room & player connections
├── persistence.ts        # Save/load game state to/from disk
├── playerAuth.ts         # Validate player IDs and turn ownership
├── types.ts              # Shared types with client
└── games/                # Directory storing saved game states
    ├── game-a3f9c2d8.json
    ├── game-b7e4d1f2.json
    └── ...
```

### 3. Client Changes

**New Components:**
- `WaitingRoom.tsx` - Pre-game lobby for players to join
- `PlayerSummary.tsx` - Public info panel (cash, share counts, turn order, online/offline status)
- `ConnectionStatus.tsx` - Shows connection state
- `WaitingForPlayer.tsx` - Overlay shown when it's another player's turn
- `PlayerIdManager.tsx` - Generates/retrieves persistent player ID

**Modified Components:**
- `Game.tsx` - Add multiplayer context, socket listeners
- `Board.tsx` - Only show tile previews for current player
- `PlayerHand.tsx` - Only show hand for current player
- `BuyModal.tsx` - Only show to current player
- `MergerLiquidation.tsx` - Only show to relevant player

**New Hooks:**
- `useSocket.ts` - Socket.io connection management
- `useGameRoom.ts` - Room joining/leaving logic

### 4. Game Flow

#### Phase 1: Waiting Room
1. Players enter room code or create new room
2. Players see list of connected players
3. Host can start game when 2-6 players ready
4. Server generates initial game state

#### Phase 2: Game Play
1. Server broadcasts game state to all clients
2. Each client filters visibility based on player ID
3. Current player sees their hand + can interact
4. Other players see public info only
5. Player actions sent to server for validation
6. Server updates state, broadcasts to all

#### Phase 3: Game End
1. Server calculates final scores
2. Display results to all players
3. Option to start new game or return to lobby

### 5. Data Flow

**Client → Server Events:**
- `registerPlayer` - Send persistent player ID to server
- `joinRoom` - Join existing game room (includes playerId)
- `createRoom` - Create new game room (includes playerId, playerName)
- `rejoinGame` - Reconnect to existing game (includes gameId, playerId)
- `startGame` - Host starts the game
- `placeTile` - Player places a tile (includes playerId for validation)
- `foundStartup` - Player founds a startup (includes playerId)
- `buyShares` - Player purchases shares (includes playerId)
- `liquidateShares` - Player liquidates during merger (includes playerId)
- `disconnect` - Player disconnects

**Server → Client Events:**
- `playerRegistered` - Confirmation of player ID
- `roomJoined` - Confirmation of room join (includes gameId)
- `roomState` - Waiting room player list
- `gameStarted` - Game has begun (includes full game state)
- `gameState` - Full game state update
- `gameResumed` - Successfully reconnected to game
- `playerTurn` - Notifies whose turn it is (includes playerId, playerName, isConnected)
- `playerConnected` - Player came online
- `playerDisconnected` - Player went offline
- `invalidMove` - Action rejected by server (reason: wrong player, invalid action, etc.)
- `invalidPlayer` - Player ID not authorized for this action
- `gameEnded` - Game over with results
- `gameSaved` - State persisted successfully (debug event)

### 6. State Visibility Rules

**Public Information (visible to all):**
- Board state (placed tiles, startups)
- Player names, turn order
- Player cash totals
- Player share counts per startup
- Player online/offline status
- Game log
- Available shares per startup
- Current stage (play, buy, merger, etc.)
- Whose turn it is (name + online status)

**Private Information (current player only):**
- Player's hand (tile cards)
- Tile placement previews on board
- Buy/merger decision modals
- Action buttons (only enabled for current player)

**Server-Only Information:**
- Tile bag contents
- Future draw order
- Validation state
- Player ID → Player mapping for authentication

### 7. Security & Validation

**Action Authentication:**
- Every game action includes the player's persistent ID
- Server validates: `action.playerId === currentPlayerInTurn.id`
- Prevents wrong player from taking someone else's turn
- Rejects actions if player ID doesn't match

**State Integrity:**
- Server validates all moves before applying
- Clients cannot see other players' hands
- Game state stored server-side (clients can't cheat)
- Room codes prevent unauthorized access
- Rate limiting on actions

**Reconnection Handling:**
- Client stores last gameId in localStorage
- On reconnect, client sends: `rejoinGame(gameId, playerId)`
- Server validates player was in that game
- Server resends current game state to reconnecting client
- Other players notified of reconnection

**Persistence & Recovery:**
- Game state auto-saved after every action
- Server can restart without losing games
- Games loaded from disk on server startup
- Corrupted save files logged and skipped

### 8. Implementation Phases

**Phase A: Server Setup**
1. Install dependencies (socket.io, express, uuid)
2. Create basic Express server
3. Set up Socket.io
4. Implement persistence layer (save/load JSON)
